This is a synth in Haskell. I'm just getting started at this point. I'm also just learning Haskell.

To get it working on Ubuntu Lucid:

sudo apt-get install ghc6 # this is Haskell. It may take a while
sudo apt-get install cabal-install # this is Haskell's library installer. a package manager in itself
sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev # pulse audio development libraries
sudo apt-get install libsndfile-dev # for sound output

cabal install pulse-simple  # an experimental Haskell bidning for pulseaudio. Note that you don't need sudo for this, it installs in ~/.cabal
cabal install hsndfile  # an experimental Haskell bidning for pulseaudio. Note that you don't need sudo for this, it installs in ~/.cabal

./build.sh
./synth.sh # run it. you should hear some sort of sound. hopefully nothing to offensive to your ears, I make no promises though! (turn down your speakers)

Some revisions so far output the file, some play via pulseaudio, which is why this depends on both. You can see in the code how to do either, it's not a big difference.

Let me know if it doesn't work and I'll add the step I forgot!
