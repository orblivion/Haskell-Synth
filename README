This is a synth in Haskell. I'm just getting started at this point. I'm also just learning Haskell.

To get it working on Ubuntu Lucid:

sudo apt-get install ghc6 # this is Haskell. It may take a while
sudo apt-get install cabal-install # this is Haskell's library installer. a package manager in itself
sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev # pulse audio development libraries
sudo apt-get install libsndfile-dev # for sound output

# an experimental Haskell bidning for pulseaudio. Note that you don't need sudo for this, it installs in ~/.cabal
cabal install pulse-simple  

# a Haskell bidning for libsndfile. Note that you don't need sudo for this, it installs in ~/.cabal
cabal install hsndfile  

./build.sh
./synth.sh # run it. you should hear some sort of sound. hopefully nothing to offensive to your ears, I make no promises though! (turn down your speakers)
./synth.sh --realtime # same as above, except that it buffers in small chunks rather than the whole sound. It is still extremely choppy, don't bother.
./synth.sh outputfile.wav # write to a specified file

Let me know if it doesn't work and I'll add the step I forgot!


Example Output:

Here's more or less the first real beat I made. This was the hardcoded output at one point. I'm too lazy to find which revision number it was:

Added the closest thing I could to a hi hat. More like a tweet, but it serves about the same purpose:
