Typeclasses:
Oscillator


Instance:
Num (I want to be able to add the output of the synths together)

Then again there was the adder module.


To Do:
wave forms:
    make construct
lfos:
    for this, have generic signal type of signal typeclass, so the restrictions pass on. ?

envelopes.
filters
    fft
ring mod

file output
file input

yaml/json parser. have every object represent the function's output. for something like amplitude you can pass another structure to get its signal, or a number to do flatsignal.
