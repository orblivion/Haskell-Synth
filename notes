Typeclasses:
Oscillator


Instance:
Num (I want to be able to add the output of the synths together)

Then again there was the adder module.


To Do:
    Apply new basic wave types to everything. For instance, have AmplitudeSignal carry Amplitudes. Specialize/Sanitize should now be one process.
lfos:
    for this, have generic signal type of signal typeclass, so the restrictions pass on. ?
    make it so that they can end safely

Signal can be DeadSignal. So that it can be treated appropriately. Sometimes you don't want to treat it as zero methinks.
    blahSignal Signal [oneItem] = whatever ++ DeadSignal
Then make all components and functions that end, safe like that. 
define clearEmptySignals

envelopes.
    have one kind of envelope. have slideTo, jumpTo, End, Stay
filters (see below)
    fft
ring mod

file input

Instruments. Control signals.
 different control signal types. one where i specify a specific time. ones where I specify in how this one starts. one where I specify how long this one will last.

yaml/json parser. have every object represent the function's output. for something like amplitude you can pass another structure to get its signal, or a number to do flatsignal.


Other Similar projects I should look at:
Yampasynth
Filters:
(quote)
a synth style filter increases the level of the harmonics around the cutoff

Q = resonance
otherwise without resonance its more of what an EQ would
do
