Typeclasses:
Oscillator


Instance:
Num (I want to be able to add the output of the synths together)

Then again there was the adder module.


To Do:
Apply new basic wave types to everything. For instance, have AmplitudeSignal carry Amplitudes. Specialize/Sanitize should now be one process.
lfos:
    for this, have generic signal type of signal typeclass, so the restrictions pass on. ?
Make signals carry Maybe Signalvalues. So they can end.

filters
    fft

Instruments. Control signals.

yaml/json parser. have every object represent the function's output. for something like amplitude you can pass another structure to get its signal, or a number to do flatsignal.
